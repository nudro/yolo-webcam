## Screenshot Instructions

To capture a screenshot of the YOLOv5 webcam detection:

1. Run the YOLOv5 webcam detection using `./run_yolo_webcam.sh`
2. When the webcam window appears with object detection, take a screenshot:
   - On macOS: Press Command + Shift + 4, then select the area
   - Or, if you prefer full screen: Press Command + Shift + 3
3. Save the screenshot as "screenshot.jpg" in the root directory of this project
4. This screenshot will be used in the README.md file

Note: If you prefer not to include your personal webcam image in the repository, 
you can consider finding a sample YOLOv5 detection image or creating one with a 
non-personal subject.
