This is a placeholder for the YOLO webcam detection screenshot.

If you don't yet have a personal screenshot, you can use a sample image from 
the YOLOv5 repository or similar object detection examples to illustrate how
the application works.

The expected screenshot would show:
- A webcam feed with bounding boxes around detected objects
- Labels for each object with confidence scores
- FPS counter in the top-left corner

Save your screenshot as "screenshot.jpg" in this directory.
